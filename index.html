    <h1>Dear Christy,</h1>
    <p>
Iâ€™m sorry for not putting myself in your shoes. I should have known that you were trying hard too. Iâ€™m sorry for repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Not talking to you made me realize how attached I actually am to you. I canâ€™t even sleep without your sleep call. It made me realize I canâ€™t focus, knowing youâ€™re not talking to me. It made me realize that I truly need you in my life.

I know what I did that night was wrongâ€”I realize it now. I shouldnâ€™t have forced you to post that WhatsApp status or acted like a jerk and sulked. I shouldnâ€™t have suggested you go home after I made you stay one more night. I truly realize now that it was all my fault. You know Iâ€™m bad at handling these things, so next time I act like this again, please slap me as hard as you can and make me realize what I did was wrong.

Iâ€™m sorryâ€”I truly am. Iâ€™m not good with words, especially when it comes to making it up to someone. This is my way of making it up to you by doing what I know bestâ€”computer stuff.

I know I canâ€™t promise that I will never mess up again, but I promise I will try my best to think before I speak next time. Losing you once was already too muchâ€”I donâ€™t think I could bear losing you again.
    </p>

      With all my love,<br />
      Your imperfect but loving partner ðŸ¥º
